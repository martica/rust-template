Basic Rust project template

To customize the template:

1. Change the product name in the Makefile
2. Rename src/template.rs to the new name
3. Change at least the name in the license file

Notes:

- The warning about copying non-implicitly copyable types has been disabled in the Makefile.
- This template is written for Rust version 0.5

Possible TODOS:

- Research crates and replace template.rs with template.rc
- Add a library template
